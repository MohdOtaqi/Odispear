Your platform now has a complete permission system:

| VIEW_CHANNEL | 1 | View channels |
| SEND_MESSAGES | 2 | Send messages in channels |
| MANAGE_MESSAGES | 4 | Delete and pin messages |
| MANAGE_CHANNELS | 8 | Create/edit/delete channels |
| MANAGE_GUILD | 16 | Edit server settings |
| KICK_MEMBERS | 32 | Kick members |
| BAN_MEMBERS | 64 | Ban and unban members |

| MANAGE_EVENTS | 4096 | Create and manage events |
| ADMINISTRATOR | 8192 | All permissions (bypasses checks) |

**Permissions are combined using bitwise OR:**
```javascript
// Example: Moderator role with multiple permissions
const permissions = 
  VIEW_CHANNEL |        // 1
  SEND_MESSAGES |       // 2
  MANAGE_MESSAGES |     // 4
  KICK_MEMBERS |        // 32
  MUTE_MEMBERS;         // 2048
// Total: 2087
```

## ðŸš€ **How to Test**

### Step 1: Rebuild Backend
```powershell
cd "C:\SandboxShare\Projects\Test 2\unity-platform"
docker-compose up --build -d backend
docker logs unity-backend --tail 50
```

### Step 2: Test Role Creation
```powershell
# Get your access token from login, then:

# Create a Moderator role
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/roles/guilds/YOUR_GUILD_ID/roles `
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{
    "name": "Moderator",
    "color": "#00FF00",
    "permissions": 2087,
    "mentionable": true,
    "hoisted": true
  }'
```

### Step 3: Test Role Assignment
```powershell
# Assign role to a member
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/roles/guilds/GUILD_ID/members/USER_ID/roles/ROLE_ID `
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Get member's roles
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/roles/guilds/GUILD_ID/members/USER_ID/roles `
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Step 4: Test Channel Permissions
```powershell
# Set channel permission override for a role
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/roles/channels/CHANNEL_ID/permissions `
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{
    "roleId": "ROLE_ID",
    "allow": 3,
    "deny": 0
  }'
```

### Step 5: Test Member Actions
```powershell
# Kick a member
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/v1/members/guilds/GUILD_ID/members/USER_ID/kick `
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"reason": "Test kick"}'

# Ban a member
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/members/guilds/GUILD_ID/bans/USER_ID `
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `

## ðŸ”§ **What Still Needs Frontend UI**

All backend APIs are complete. You need to build frontend components for:

### 1. Server Settings Page
- Roles tab (create, edit, delete, reorder roles)
- Members tab (view members, manage roles, kick/ban)
- Invites tab (create and manage invites)

### 2. Channel Settings Modal
- Permissions tab (role and user overrides)
- General settings (name, topic, slowmode)

### 3. Member Context Menu (Right-click on member)
- View profile
- Assign roles
- Change nickname
- Kick
- Ban
- Mute/deafen

### 4. Role Management UI
- Role color picker
- Permission checkboxes (14 permissions)
- Drag-to-reorder roles
- Member count per role

---

## ðŸ’¡ **Quick Tips**

### Permission Checking
The backend automatically checks permissions for all actions. For example:
- Only users with `MANAGE_ROLES` can create/edit/delete roles
- Only users with `KICK_MEMBERS` can kick members
- Only users with `BAN_MEMBERS` can ban/unban
- Guild owners bypass all permission checks
- `ADMINISTRATOR` permission bypasses all checks

### Role Hierarchy
- Roles are ordered by `position` (higher = more powerful)
- Users can only manage roles below their highest role
- Cannot kick/ban users with equal or higher roles
- Cannot modify roles above your highest role

### Channel Permission Overrides
- Overrides can be set for roles OR specific users
- `allow` permissions are granted explicitly
- `deny` permissions are removed explicitly
- Calculation: `(base_permissions & ~deny) | allow`
